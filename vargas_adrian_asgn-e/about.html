	<h3> Martin Venezky: Artist, Designer, Maker </h3>
    <p>Martin Venezky is an internationally recognized American artist, graphic designer, photographer, and educator whose work challenges conventional boundaries between disciplines and media. Over a career spanning four decades, Venezky has developed a practice rooted in close engagement with materials, meticulous craft, and an ongoing questioning of how visual language functions in both graphic design and fine art. <br /><br />
	After earning a BA in Visual Studies at Dartmouth College and an MFA in Design from the Cranbrook Academy of Art, Venezky emerged as a prominent figure in contemporary design. He founded the influential design studio Appetite Engineers in San Francisco in 1997, producing graphic work that spans magazine design, book projects, exhibition catalogs, festival identities, and visual communication for cultural institutions. His graphic designs-characterized by dense collage, layered typography, and inventive juxtapositions-exemplify his belief that design should be both expressive and materially complex. <br /><br />
	Venezky's philosophy emphasizes process over preconception. He often begins with found objects, analog drawing, or photographic capturing of everyday materials, embracing a hybrid method that bridges hands-on making with digital compositing. This experimental approach reflects an interest in revealing hidden structures in form and image while celebrating the subtle irregularities that emerge from manual engagement. <br /><br />
	His work has been recognized by major institutions: a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) featured selections of his designs from their permanent Architecture and Design collection, and his monograph It Is Beautiful ... Then Gone was published by Princeton Architectural Press. Additionally, his work is held in important public and private collections, and he was inducted into the Alliance Graphique Internationale-a mark of distinction in graphic arts. <br /><br />
	In parallel with his studio practice, Venezky has been a significant educator, teaching typography and design at the California College of the Arts (where he is Professor Emeritus), RISD, CalArts, and other institutions. His teaching and creative work continually reflect a belief in design as a site of inquiry, where making and thinking converge.
